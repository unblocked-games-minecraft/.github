unblocked minecraftâ€‹ is an idle/management game where you control a cute monkey character who is in charge of a supermarket. Plant fruits, harvest produce, and move around from station to station to fill the stands with various food items. Sell bananas, corn, eggs, peanuts, coffee beans, chocolate, wheat, and more! Your customers will pick them up and wait for you at the cashier deskâ€”simply stand next to the cash register to collect your money.  

As you unlock new aisles and grow your market with additional products, you can hire assistants to help oversee aisle maintenance and other tasks. You can also purchase appliances to prepare advanced products from your harvest, such as chocolate bars, coffee, yogurt, popcorn, peanut butter, muffins, cookies, ice cream, and more! Make sure to upgrade your character's management skills, unlock new workstations, and teach your staff new skills. Donâ€™t forget to wear cool hats to manage your market in style! Do you have what it takes to make your farmerâ€™s market the best in town?
